# Galaxy Number Counts in a Single CCD Field

This repository contains the code for my Year 3 Astrophysics lab project. The figures and numerical results produced by this
code are used in the written lab report.

1. **Data**

   The analysis uses the following FITS images, provided as part of the lab:

   - `mosaic.fits`  
     Raw (or pipeline–reduced) CCD mosaic.

   - `mosaic_cleaned_enhanced.fits`  
     Mosaic after saturated–star and halo cleaning.  
     This is generated by the halo–removal notebook in this repository.



2. **Environment and dependencies**

   The analysis is done in Python using Jupyter notebooks.

   Tested with:

   - Python 3.14.0
   - `numpy`  
   - `scipy`  
   - `astropy`  
   - `matplotlib`  
   - `photutils` (optional; used only in some experiments)



3. **Repository contents**

   Main notebooks:

   - `read_mosaic.ipynb`  
     Load `mosaic.fits`, display the image, compute background statistics  
     (median, MAD-based sigma), and inspect the raw field.

   - `histogram_mosaic.ipynb`  
     Make histograms of pixel values, fit a Gaussian to the sky distribution, and  
     verify the global background and sigma used for detection thresholds.

   - `background_saturation_remove.ipynb`  
     Explore methods to identify and remove saturated regions and the bright-star  
     halo. Implements:  
     - background and sigma estimates  
     - saturation thresholds  
     - connected–component labelling  
     - k–nearest–neighbour (kNN) density–based halo removal  
     - creation of `mosaic_cleaned_enhanced.fits`  
     - diagnostic plots (before/after cleaning)

   - `aperture photometry.ipynb`  
     Implements circular aperture photometry with a 3 arcsec diameter:  
     - converts the 3″ diameter to a pixel radius using the 0.258″/pix scale  
     - estimates local sky using an annulus (inner and outer radii in pixels)  
     - computes net flux and basic flux uncertainty  
     - tests the photometry on bright isolated sources

   - `analysis.ipynb`  
     Main analysis process:  
     - source detection using a threshold of `bg + 5σ`  
     - minimum area and edge cuts on detections  
     - optional application of the kNN-based halo mask  
     - star/galaxy separation using a concentration index and equal-area radius  
     - conversion of net flux to calibrated magnitudes using the photometric  
       zero point

   - `results.ipynb`  
     Final products:  
     - cumulative `log N(m)` vs calibrated magnitude  
     - separate curves for all sources, stars, and galaxies  
     - Poisson error bars for each bin  
     - weighted linear fits to the galaxy `log N – m` relation over a chosen  
       magnitude range  
     - exploration of how tuning (fit range, kNN parameters) affects the slope  
       and its uncertainty  
     - export of the final plots for use in the report  



4. **How to run the analysis**

   A typical order to reproduce the figures and numbers in the report is:

   1. **Inspect the raw mosaic**  
      - Open `read_mosaic.ipynb`.  
      - Copy `mosaic.fits` into the repository root.  
      - Run the notebook to display the field and compute the global background  
        and sigma.

   2. **Check the histogram and sky fit**  
      - Open `histogram_mosaic.ipynb`.  
      - Run to generate pixel-value histograms and fit a Gaussian to the sky.  
      - Confirm that the background level and sigma used for detection are  
        reasonable.

   3. **Clean the saturated star and halo**  
      - Open `background_saturation_remove.ipynb`.  
      - Run to:  
        - identify saturated cores and bleed trails,  
        - apply the kNN-based density filter to remove the bright halo ring,  
        - write `mosaic_cleaned_enhanced.fits`,  
        - produce before and after detection overlays.  
      - The cleaned mosaic is the one used for the final number–count analysis.

   4. **Test aperture photometry**  
      - Open `aperture photometry.ipynb`.  
      - Run to check that:  
        - the aperture and sky annulus are correctly converted to pixels,  
        - the local sky estimates look sensible,  
        - the net fluxes for bright isolated objects behave as expected.

   5. **Build the source catalogue and classify objects**  
      - Open `analysis.ipynb`.  
      - Choose the input image (`mosaic_cleaned_enhanced.fits` for the final  
        results).  
      - Run to:  
        - detect sources at `bg + 5σ`,  
        - apply minimum-area and edge cuts,  
        - apply the halo mask from the kNN step,  
        - perform aperture photometry for all remaining detections,  
        - classify objects as stars or galaxies using concentration and size.

   6. **Compute number counts and fit the log N – m relation**  
      - Open `results.ipynb`.  
      - Run to:  
        - construct cumulative counts `N(m)` and `logN(m)` in magnitude bins,  
        - make curves for all sources, stars only, and galaxies only,  
        - add Poisson error bars,  
        - perform weighted straight-line fits to the **galaxy** `log N – m`  
          relation over the chosen magnitude range,  
        - optionally test how the fitted slope changes with:  
          - fitting range,  
          - kNN crowded-fraction and grid size,  
        - save the final plots for report.
