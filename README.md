# Galaxy Number Counts in a Single CCD Field

This repository contains the code used for my Year 3 Astrophysics lab

The analysis includes:

Background measurement and bad–pixel handling  
Saturated–star and halo cleaning
Source detection and basic star/galaxy separation  
Aperture photometry with a 3″ diameter  
Construction and fitting of log N(m) vs. magnitude

The figures and numerical results produced by this code are used in my lab report.


# 1. Data

The analysis assumes the following FITS files are available:

  'mosaic.fits' 
    Raw (or pipeline–reduced) CCD mosaic provided as part of the lab.

  'mosaic_cleaned_enhanced.fits'  
    Version of the mosaic after saturated–star / halo cleaning.  
    This file can be generated by the halo–removal notebook in this repo.



# 2. Dependencies

The code is written in Python and uses Jupyter notebooks.

Tested with:

  Python 3.14.0
  numpy
  scipy
  astropy
  matplotlib
  photutils (optional; only used in some experimental approaches)



# 3. Repository structure

Main notebooks:

'read_mosaic.ipynb'
  Load mosaic.fits, inspect the image, compute background statistics (median, MAD–based sigma), and visualise the raw field.

'histogram_mosaic.ipynb'
  Make histograms of pixel values, fit a Gaussian to the sky distribution, and verify the global background used for detection thresholds.

'background_saturation_remove.ipynb'
  Explore methods to identify saturated regions, bleeding columns, and the bright–star halo. 
  Implements:
    background,
    saturation thresholds,
    connected–component labelling,
    k–nearest–neighbour (kNN) density–based halo removal,
    generation of mosaic_cleaned_enhanced.fits.

'aperture photometry.ipynb'
  Implements circular aperture photometry with a 3″ diameter:
    radius from pixel scale (0.258″/pix),
    local sky from an annulus (r_in, r_out),
    net flux and basic uncertainty estimate,
    tests on bright isolated sources.

'analysis.ipynb'
  Main science process:
    source detection using a threshold of bg + 5σ, with a minimum area cut,
    removing detections in the kNN–defined halo region,
    star/galaxy separation using a concentration index and equal–radius size,
    conversion of net flux to calibrated magnitude using a zero point,
    construction of cumulative counts for all sources, stars, and galaxies.

'results.ipynb'
  Final products:
    cumulative $\log_{10} N(<m)$ vs. calibrated magnitude for all/stellar/galaxy samples,
    Poisson error bars for each bin,
    weighted linear fits to the galaxy $\log N$–$m$ relation over a chosen magnitude range,
    exploration of how changing the fit range or kNN parameters affects the slope and its uncertainty,
    plots use in the report.


# 4. Workflow / how to reproduce the analysis

A typical workflow to reproduce the figures and numbers in the report:

\tab 1. Inspect the data

Open read_mosaic.ipynb.

Check that mosaic.fits is in the repository root.

Run the notebook to confirm the background level and general appearance.

Pixel histogram and sky Gaussian

Run histogram_mosaic.ipynb to:

verify the sky distribution is roughly Gaussian,

obtain bg and σ used for detection thresholds.

Saturation and halo cleaning

Open background_saturation_remove.ipynb.

Run to:

identify saturated cores and bright halos,

apply the kNN density–based halo mask,

write out mosaic_cleaned_enhanced.fits.

The detection overlay plots here (before/after kNN) correspond to the
figures showing halo removal in the report.

Aperture photometry tests

Run aperture photometry.ipynb.

Verify that the 3″ aperture, annulus choice and background subtraction
behave sensibly on bright, isolated objects.

Main catalogue and classification

Open analysis.ipynb.

Choose whether to use mosaic.fits or mosaic_cleaned_enhanced.fits
as input (the report uses the cleaned version for the final counts).

Run the notebook to:

detect sources using bg + 5σ,

apply the kNN halo filter,

perform aperture photometry for the remaining sources,

classify stars vs galaxies.

Number counts and fits

Run results.ipynb to:

build cumulative counts $\log_{10} N(<m)$ for:

all sources,

stars only,

galaxies only;

compute Poisson error bars;

perform weighted linear fits to the galaxy curve over the chosen
magnitude range (e.g. $m \in [11, 16.5]$);

optionally explore the effect of changing:

the magnitude range,

kNN crowded fraction and grid size.

This notebook generates the final plots (e.g. logN–m curves and fitted
lines) used in the report.
Running the notebooks in the order above should reproduce all the figures and numerical values quoted in the report.
